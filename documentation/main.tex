This documentation presented the architecture, technical design, and implementation details of the Contract Central project. The system combines a mobile/web frontend built with Flutter, a scalable backend hosted on Google Cloud, and AI-driven document analysis using Gemini and ChromaDB.

Each component was developed as an independent microservice to promote modularity and ease of maintenance. The CI/CD pipeline, based on GitHub Actions, enables automated testing and deployment to Cloud Run.

The frontend was designed to offer a smooth, cross-platform user experience, while the backend ensures security and scalability through asynchronous messaging and vector-based search.

This project highlights the power of combining cloud infrastructure, AI, and cross-platform development to deliver a real-world solution for contract management.
