\chapter{Introduction}

This project is a web application composed of several interconnected microservices. The goal is to provide users with access to their documents, automated analysis of their content, and an intuitive interface.

\section{Communication}
Microservices communicate through \textbf{Google Pub/Sub}, using structured messages.

\section{Frontend}
The frontend (built with Flutter) interacts with the main backend API. It provides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item user account management,
    \item document upload,
    \item visualization of document analysis results.
\end{itemize}
